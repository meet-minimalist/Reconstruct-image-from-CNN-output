Visualize input from CNN output using Keras and Tensorflow

_In this work, I would like to show the attempts to visualize the input from CNN output using VGG16 model in Keras and Tensorflow. In both the implementation, I failed to create visualizations as per the expectation. I was expecting that the image generated from the network should resemble with the class image. But it didn't performed as per the expectations._
